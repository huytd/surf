surf - simple webkit-based browser
==================================
surf is a simple Web browser based on WebKit/GTK+.

Patches applied
---------------
In this repository, I made some new commits to apply the two patches:

    9d0d9  Add unicode support in dmenu
    d8746  Add homepage support. By default it will open https://duckduckgo.com
    508d5  Add ability to download file. Files will be saved in /tmp folder
    
All patches are downloaded from https://surf.suckless.org/patches

This fork also supports VIM-like navigation. All you need to do is copy scripts/script.js file to your ~/.surf/script.js

VIM-like navigation:

    h,j,k,l  Scrolling
    g, G     Jump to top/bottom of current page
    f, F     Show link hint then open in current page or in new tab
    Esc      Exit link hint mode

Requirements
------------
In order to build surf you need GTK+ and Webkit/GTK+ header files.

In order to use the functionality of the url-bar, also install dmenu[0].

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (surf is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install surf (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running surf
------------
run
	surf [URI]

See the manpage for further options.

Running surf in tabbed
----------------------
For running surf in tabbed[1] there is a script included in the distribution,
which is run like this:

	surf-open.sh [URI]

Further invocations of the script will run surf with the specified URI in this
instance of tabbed.
